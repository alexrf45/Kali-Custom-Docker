# Custom Kali Docker Image:

[Docker Hub Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fonalex45/project-repo-1)

This is custom kali docker image that saves on installation time of tools and potential dependencies issues. I add to the image every so often as I discover more tools or find a better alias for a particular container. Please feel free to fork and modify to your liking. Thank you!!! 

## Tested on: Ubuntu 20.04-2, Debian 10+, Xubuntu 20.04.2 and ubuntu-budgie-20.04

## I highly recommend installing this on a lightweight Linux distro to reduce overall VM size. Less complexity = more time for fun!

UPDATE 2021-09-10:
- Added Autorecon to the Docker image.
